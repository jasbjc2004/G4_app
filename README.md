## 1. NEEDED
This map contains all files needed to let the program work. 

## 2. Old version
This map contains all the files from a previous version of the app. So these files are all extra for information and possible ideas for an extention in the main software. Not needed to let the program work.

## 3. Test Files
All files needed to test all different parts of the project. Not needed to let the program work.

## 4. app
All files related to the software, all are needed to let it work. In this map is also a code to make the .exe from all the other files, so the next person doesn't need to type all of it. The software can be made using 'Inno Setup Compiler'.
